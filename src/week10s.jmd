## 1. Orthogonal Polynomial Roots



Consider heat on a Graph
$$
𝐮_t
$$
Use $U_n(x)$ and its roots to diagonalise the problem and hence deduce an explicit formula. 


## 2. Interpolatory quadrature


## 3. Gaussian quadrature

**Problem** Show for $w(x) = 1/\sqrt{1-x^2}$ that the Gaussian quadrature rule is
$$
{\pi \over n} \sum_{j=1}^n f(x_j)
$$
where $x_j = (j-1/2)π/n$.
